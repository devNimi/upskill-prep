### Problem Recap:
You have two identical DOM trees, `A` and `B`, which have the same structure and elements. Given an element from tree `A`, your task is to find the corresponding element in tree `B`. 

A DOM (Document Object Model) tree is essentially a hierarchical structure of HTML elements. Each element is represented as a node, and elements can have parent nodes, child nodes, and siblings.

### What You Need to Do:
You need to find the **same element** in `B` given the **same element's position** in `A`. You are given a reference to an element in `A` and the root of tree `B`.

To achieve this, the key observation is that each element in tree `A` has a **unique path** from the root of tree `A` to that element. If you know the path to an element in `A`, you can find the corresponding element in tree `B` using the same path.

---

### Explanation of the Solution:

The solution is a function called `backwardsPath`. Let's go through the code and explain each part.

```javascript
function backwardsPath(element, root) {
    const path = [];
    let current = element;

    // Traverse the tree upwards from the element until we reach the root
    while (current.parentNode) {
        // Find the index of the element within its parent’s children
        const index = [...current.parentNode.children].indexOf(current);
        path.push(index);  // Store the index in the path
        current = current.parentNode;  // Move up to the parent
    }

    current = root;  // Start from the root of tree B
    while (path.length) {
        // Pop the last index from the path and move to the corresponding child
        current = current.children[path.pop()];
    }

    return current;  // Return the corresponding element in tree B
}
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **The Path Array:**

```javascript
const path = [];
```
The `path` array will hold the indices of each element's position relative to its parent in tree `A`. For example, if an element is the second child of its parent, its index will be `1` (0-based index).

#### 2. **Traversing the Element Upwards:**

```javascript
let current = element;
while (current.parentNode) {
    const index = [...current.parentNode.children].indexOf(current);
    path.push(index);
    current = current.parentNode;
}
```
In this part, you're traversing the tree upwards (from the given `element` towards the root). The loop continues as long as the element has a `parentNode`.

- For each element, you determine its **index** in its parent's `children` collection.
- You convert the `current.parentNode.children` NodeList into an array using the spread syntax (`[...]`) because `NodeList` doesn't have array methods like `indexOf`.
- You then push this index into the `path` array.
- Move up to the parent node by setting `current = current.parentNode`.

By the time you finish this loop, you will have the **path** of indices that describe how to reach the element from the root of tree `A`. The path will be in reverse order, i.e., starting from the element and going up to the root.

#### 3. **Walking the Path in Tree B:**

```javascript
current = root;
while (path.length) {
    current = current.children[path.pop()];
}
```
Now that we have the **path** from tree `A`, we can use it to find the corresponding element in tree `B`.

- You start from the `root` of tree `B`.
- You **pop** each index from the `path` array (which will reverse the path back to the correct order).
- For each index popped, you move to the corresponding child in `current.children`.
  
The `path.pop()` gets the last index from the `path` array, and `current.children[path.pop()]` takes you to the corresponding child of `current` (which starts as `root`).

You continue this process until you've followed the entire path and `current` will end up pointing to the corresponding element in tree `B`.

#### 4. **Return the Found Element:**

```javascript
return current;
```
Finally, the `current` variable will be the element in tree `B` that corresponds to the element in tree `A`. This is the element you were looking for.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s walk through an example to make this clearer. Assume the following simple DOM trees:

#### Tree A:
```
A (root)
 ├── B
 │   └── D (element we want to find)
 └── C
```

#### Tree B:
```
X (root)
 ├── Y
 │   └── D (same element as in A)
 └── Z
```

Let’s say we are given the element `D` in tree `A` and we need to find the corresponding `D` in tree `B`.

#### Step 1: Find the path to `D` in tree `A`.
- Starting from `D`, we move upwards to `B`, which is its parent. 
- Then, move further upwards to `A` (root).
- The path is `[0, 0]` (index 0 in `B`, and index 0 in `A`).

#### Step 2: Follow the path in tree `B`.
- Start from the root of tree `B`.
- First, move to `Y` (index `0` in `X`).
- Then, move to `D` (index `0` in `Y`).

At the end of the function, `D` in tree `B` is returned.

### Understanding Tree Data Structure:

You might not have read about trees before, so let me quickly explain the tree structure.

- A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node (element) can have multiple children, but only one parent (except the root, which has no parent).
- The **root** is the top-most node, and from there, you can reach every other node.
- A node's **children** are the nodes directly below it.
- A node’s **parent** is the node directly above it.

In the case of the DOM, each element in the HTML document is a node in a tree, and its position can be described using its path from the root.

---

### Summary:

1. The function `backwardsPath` takes an element and the root of tree `B`.
2. It calculates the **path** from the element to the root in tree `A`.
3. Then, it uses the same path to find the corresponding element in tree `B`.
4. The solution works because the trees are identical, and the path to an element uniquely identifies it across both trees.
